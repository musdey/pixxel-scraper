## Lead scraper

# Project Overview
My co-founder required a tool to extract leads from a list of URLs contained in a CSV file. These URLs led to various professionals, including doctors, small businesses, and companies. The goal was to retrieve contact details such as emails, phone numbers, websites, and other relevant information. Initially, I manually wrote a script to perform this task. However, I realized it would be more efficient to develop a tool that could automate the process.

Thus, I created a simple Next.js application. This tool allowed users to upload a CSV file and enter an email address. Once the scraping was completed, the results were sent directly to the provided email. We offered this tool for free on our subdomain, wwww.scraper.pixxel.solutions, to a small community of businesses that needed such services. The tool was well-received and used frequently until we recently decided to stop the servers.

PS: No worries, I usually do not commit credentials. I usally use .env files or git-secrets. ;)
